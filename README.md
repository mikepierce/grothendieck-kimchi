# Grothendieck's Kimchi

An English translation of Alexander Grothendieck's writing on kimchi formatted in HTML. I have nothing to do with its translation; I just crowdsourced/open-sourced the translation here on github. A scan of the original French can be found [here on the website of Thibault Damour](http://www.ihes.fr/~damour/IMAGE/kimchi_grothendieck.pdf). A live version of this translation can be found at [math.ucr.edu/~mpierce/kimchi](http://math.ucr.edu/~mpierce/kimchi/).

To anyone who updates the translation, leave notes in the next section of this README.md to guide the next translator.

And to anyone who really likes translating French → English, notice this crowdsourced [project to translate Grothendieck's SGA](https://github.com/jmoellermath/translate-SGAI).

# Notes for Translatores

 - So far the file `kimchi.html` just contains an OCR rending of the original PDF in French. It's separated into sections 1–7, which you can see enumerated by hand in the PDF. The file is HTML because the translated version will be hosted on the web, but I can take care of the HTML markup; we really need people who can translate French → English.
